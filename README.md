# ðŸŒ¿ EcoData â€“ Environmental Data Reporting Tool

*EcoData* is a web-based platform that allows users to generate environmental reports and view ecological data from multiple public sources. It is designed to help people better understand the state of the environment in a specific region or over time by providing ready-made dashboards and customisable reports.

The system connects to open data APIs, processes the information, and presents it in a clear, visual format. Users can choose specific indicators, set filters by location and time, and receive updates when pollution levels exceed safe thresholds.

Intended for everyday users â€” such as journalists, students, researchers, or government staff â€” who need quick access to environmental statistics without having to work directly with raw data.

## Key Features

- **Custom Report Generation**
  Create detailed or summary reports filtered by region, date range, and environmental indicators such as air quality, water pollution, COâ‚‚ emissions, etc.
- **Live Dashboard**
  Real-time visual overview of key ecological metrics. Includes trend charts, regional comparisons, and critical alerts.
- **Flexible Data Integration**
  Connect to multiple open data APIs and formats (JSON, XML, CSV), including meteorological services, environmental agencies, and scientific repositories.
- **Scheduled Data Syncing**
  Automatically update your datasets with the latest available information at scheduled intervals.
- **Notification System**
  Receive alerts when monitored indicators exceed safe thresholds, configurable per user.
